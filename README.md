# Indian_IPO
It is a project to predict the long term gains by investing in Indian IPOs.

This Notebook focuses on long term value of investment in IPO and predict whether the IPO will be profitable in years to come or not based on the various features. The data consists of the IPOs which came from 2010 till 2020. I have made prediction on what could be the price of each IPO at the start of 2021, also in the end I have determined the accuracy of the algorithm, that is how many times it gives correct prediction whether the IPO gain percentage will go up or down based on the Current Gains % target column.
